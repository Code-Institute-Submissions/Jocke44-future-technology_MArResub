                    <h2>Theories of technology </h2>
                    <p>Theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high
                        technology and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology
                        is uncertain.</p>

                    <h2>Predictions</h2>
                    <p>In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an
                        overlapping "GNR Revolution" of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, with robotics being the
                        most
                        important of the three. This future revolution has been explored in films, novels, and video
                        games, which have predicted the creation of many inventions, as well as foreseeing future
                        events.
                        Such inventions and events include a government-controlled simulation that resulted from massive
                        robotics advancements, (The Matrix), a society that has rid itself of procreation due to
                        improvements in genetic engineering (Brave New World), and a police state enforced by the
                        government
                        using datamining, nanobots, and drones (Watch Dogs). Humans have already made some of the first
                        steps toward achieving the GNR revolution.</p>

                    <h2>Recent discoveries</h2>
                    <p>Recent discoveries and ingenuity has allowed us to create robotics in the form of Artificial
                        Intelligence, as well as in the physical form of robots. Artificial intelligence has been used
                        for a
                        variety of purposes, including personal assistants in a smart phone, the first of which was
                        Siri,
                        released in the iPhone 4s in 2011 by Apple. Some believe that the future of robotics will
                        involve a 'greater than human non-biological intelligence. This concept can be compared to
                        that
                        of a 'rogue AI,' an Artificial Intelligence that has gained self-awareness, and tries to
                        eradicate
                        humanity. Others believe that the future will involve AI servants creating an easy and
                        effortless
                        life for humankind, where robots have become the primary work force. This future shares many
                        similarities with the concept of planned obsolescence, however, planned obsolescence is seen as
                        a
                        "sinister business strategy. Man-controlled robots such as drones have been developed to
                        carry
                        out tasks such as bomb defusal and space exploration. Universities such as Harvard are working
                        towards the invention of autonomous robots to be used in situations that would aid humans, such
                        as
                        surgery robots, search and rescue robots, and physical therapy robots.</p>

                    <h2>Exploration of Genetics</h2>
                    <p>Genetics have also been explored, with humans understanding genetic engineering to a certain
                        degree.
                        However, gene editing is widely divisive, and usually involves some degree of eugenics. Some
                        have
                        speculated the future of human engineering to include 'super humans,' humans who have been
                        genetically engineered to be faster, stronger, and more survivable than current humans. Others
                        think
                        that genetic engineering will be used to make humans more resistant or completely immune to some
                        diseases. Some even suggest that 'cloning,' the process of creating an exact copy of a
                        human,
                        may be possible through genetic engineering</p>

                    <h2>Some Believe</h2>
                    <p>Some believe that within the next 10 years, humans will discover nanobot technology, while others
                        believe that we are centuries away from its invention. It is believed by futurists that nanobot
                        technology will allow humans to 'manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic scale.' This
                        discovery could pave the way for many scientific and medical advancements, such as curing new
                        diseases, or inventing new, more efficient technology. It is also believed that nanobots could
                        be
                        injected or otherwise inserted inside the human body, and replace certain parts, keeping humans
                        healthy for an incredibly long amount of time, or combating organ failure to a degree.</p>
